👋 Hey! I'm looking for a job as a Senior Frontend Engineer (React, TypeScript). I have 7+ years of commercial experience, brought several large projects to production, and explored many interesting things. Worked at [Ticketscloud](https://github.com/ticketscloud) — we launched concerts for Ed Sheeran, Hurts, Imagine Dragons, and of course, Zemfira.

* Building architecture, setting up CI, and diving deep into build tooling
* Caring about UX — not just “coding the Figma”, but shaping better product flows
* Exploring beyond the web — I explore anything that interests me, like [buckwheat.app](https://github.com/danilkinkin/buckwheat)
* Taking initiative, thinking about the product, and working on what truly inspires
* Open to remote, hybrid, or relocation (currently in Serbia 🇷🇸). Speak English and Russian.
