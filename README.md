👋 Hey! I'm looking for a job as a Senior Frontend Engineer (React, TypeScript). I have 7+ years of commercial experience, brought several large projects to production, and explored many interesting things. Worked at [Ticketscloud](https://github.com/ticketscloud) — we launched concerts for Ed Sheeran, Hurts, Imagine Dragons, and of course, Zemfira.

What I am good at:
* Build architecture, set up CI, and dive deep into build tooling
* Optimize heavy interfaces and rendering
* Care about UX — not just “code the Figma”, but shape better product flows
* Not limited to the web — I explore anything that interests me
* Take initiative, don’t wait for tasks. I think about the product and work on things that genuinely inspire me

Open to remote, hybrid, or relocation (currently in Serbia 🇷🇸). Speak English and Russian.  
Let’s connect — happy to chat or jump on a quick call.  
If you know someone who’s hiring — intros are deeply appreciated 🙏

Thanks!
